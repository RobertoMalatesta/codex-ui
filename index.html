<h2>What is The Purpose of This Site?</h2>
<p>Simply a collection of components I have built using Bootstrap 4. They should be Plug n Play and require no extra css or JS.</p>
<p>I am working off of two premiss for this UI library / Kit.</p>
<ol>
    <li>No custom CSS to be added. Meaning you don't have to modify any bootstrap css values. Our goal is to completely use the utilities in Bootstrap 4 to our benefit.</li>
    <li>No custom JS to be added. No dependencies to add custom Javascript to your website. This way we won't conflict with anything that has been done on sites before.</li>
</ol>
<p>All components should basically be copy and paste for sites that use Bootstrap 4.</p>
<p>The one, ONE, caveat to that right now is font awesome. I require some sort of icons for certain components, and since font awesome is one of the easiest to just drop in I am using that. Feel free to replace the icons with your own icon framework.</p> 
<p>If a component does require font awesome it will be notated at the very top of that components page. To learn more and download Font Awesome visit <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">http://fontawesome.io/</a></p>
