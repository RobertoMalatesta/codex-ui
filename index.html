        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>Here you will find a collection of bootstrap 4 components.</p>
        <p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Some items require Font Awesome in order for them to look right, this is because Bootstrap 4 does not ship with a default
    icon library. I choose Font Awesome because I have been a long time supporter. I will update this to use Font Awesome 5 once
    the free icons are released with full licenses.
</p>
<p>To learn more and download Font Awesome visit <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">http://fontawesome.io/</a></p>

<h2>What is The Purpose of This Site?</h2>
<p>Simply a collection of components I have built using Bootstrap 4. I try to keep it as simple as default bootstrap classes and styles,
    that way you can just plug these components into any Bootstrap 4 website.
