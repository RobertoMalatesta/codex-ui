## View Components

To view a full list of components that are both done and on the road map simply go to [https://shadowcodex.github.io/codex-ui/components/](https://shadowcodex.github.io/codex-ui/components/)

## How To Use

Just copy and paste. Each component will have a `code:` section below it. Just copy that code and paste it into your site. As long as you have bootstrap 4 running on the site, they components should just "work". 

If they don't and you can't figure out why open an issue and I'll gladly help as much as I can!

## Restrictions

I am working off of two premiss for this UI library / Kit. 

1. No custom CSS to be added. Meaning you don't have to modify any bootstrap css values. Our goal is to completely use the utilities in Bootstrap 4 to our benefit.
2. No custom JS to be added. No dependencies to add custom Javascript to your website. This way we won't conflict with anything that has been done on sites before.

All components should basically be copy and paste for sites that use Bootstrap 4.

The one, ONE, caveat to that right now is font awesome. I require some sort of icons for certain components, and since font awesome is one of the easiest to just drop in I am using that. Feel free to replace the icons with your own icon framework.

If a component does require font awesome it will be notated at the very top of that components page.

## Contributions

I am open to contributions to the components, you could contribute in many ways:

1. Create a new component
2. Request a new component
3. Post bugs as issues
4. Help answer issues as they come up

Any new components or pull requests will be reviewed to make sure they fit the restrictions before pulling them into the repo.
